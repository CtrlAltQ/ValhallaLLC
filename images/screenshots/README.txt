SCREENSHOTS NEEDED FOR PWA

The following screenshot files are referenced in manifest.json and need to be created:

1. homepage-mobile.png (375x812 pixels)
2. portfolio-mobile.png (375x812 pixels)
3. homepage-desktop.png (1280x720 pixels)
4. portfolio-desktop.png (1280x720 pixels)

These screenshots should be actual captures of the website to provide preview images when installing the PWA.

For now, you can take screenshots of the live site once it's deployed, or create mockups based on the current design.
