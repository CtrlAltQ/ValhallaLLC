- **Fix**: Used both `grid-gap` and `gap` properties
- **Issue**: Flexbox alignment
- **Fix**: Added fallback alignment properties

### Chrome
- **Issue**: Animation performance
- **Fix**: Added `transform: translateZ(0)` for hardware acceleration

## Testing Tools

### Automated Testing
- **Cross-Browser Test Utility**: `test-compatibility.html`
- **Browser Compatibility Checker**: `js/utils/browser-compatibility.js`
- **Feature Detection**: Built-in feature detection system

### Manual Testing
1. Open `test-compatibility.html` in each target browser
2. Run the automated compatibility tests
3. Review the results and address any failures
4. Test interactive elements manually
5. Verify responsive design at different screen sizes

### Development Tools
- **Chrome DevTools**: Primary development and debugging
- **Firefox Developer Tools**: CSS Grid and Flexbox debugging
- **Safari Web Inspector**: iOS-specific testing
- **Edge DevTools**: Microsoft-specific compatibility

## Common Issues and Solutions

### CSS Issues
- **Custom Properties**: Fallback values for older browsers
- **Grid Layout**: Flexbox fallbacks for unsupported browsers
- **Backdrop Filter**: Webkit prefixes for Safari

### JavaScript Issues
- **Intersection Observer**: Polyfill for older browsers
- **Fetch API**: Polyfill for IE and older browsers
- **Promises**: Polyfill for legacy browser support

### Image Issues
- **WebP Support**: JPEG fallbacks for unsupported browsers
- **Lazy Loading**: Intersection Observer fallback
- **High DPI**: Proper image scaling and rendering

## Performance Considerations

### Loading Performance
- Images are optimized and served in modern formats
- Critical CSS is inlined
- JavaScript is loaded asynchronously
- Service worker caches resources

### Runtime Performance
- Animations use hardware acceleration
- Event listeners are optimized
- Memory usage is monitored
- Scroll performance is optimized

## Accessibility Testing

### Screen Readers
- **NVDA** (Windows)
- **JAWS** (Windows)

### Keyboard Navigation
- Tab order is logical

- Color-blind friendly design
- Sufficient contrast ratios

## Deployment Testing

3. Verify all features work correctly
4. Check performance metrics

### Post-deployment
1. Test on production environment
2. Verify CDN and caching work
3. Check analytics tracking
4. Monitor error logs

## Continuous Testing
